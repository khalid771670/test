	<p>&mdash;You might be unmotivated because you feel stuck in your career. If your days seem to blend together and you're tired of repeating the same tasks, set goals to boost your motivation. Think of obtainable goals to work toward in your career. For example, commit to earning a raise or promotion, or to developing an innovative idea that will improve your work environment for everyone. Choose goals that excite you, as this will inspire and motivate you more than goals you feel indifferent toward. Be creative, and spend time determining the steps you need to take to reach your goals.</p>
